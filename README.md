# DioAppFinder
A simple nice fast application finder/launcher.
By default it only searches for desktop files in /usr/share/applications
You can add your own custom paths in .config/dioappfinder/dioappfinder.conf or use dioappfinder-settings to manage the paths. It was tested on Debian 12.

# What you can do with DioAppFinder
   1. Search for installed applications (desktop files).
   2. Launch selected application.
   3. Add a custom path to look for desktop files in.
   4. Right click on selected item to add it to favorites.

# Note
   If you want to use 'Add to favorites' option, you need to also install DioPanelMenu:
